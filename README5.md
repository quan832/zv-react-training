# Training 5 - Advanced React: Redux and React Redux

## Overview
- Introduction to fundemental of functional programming
  - Immutable
  - What is a side effect?
  - Benefit of functional programming
  - The role of functional programming in Redux architecture
  - Using JS functional functions: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `some`, `every`
- Introduction to Redux architecture
- Understanding Redux architecture data flow (Uni-directional data flow)
  - What is a redux action?
  - What is a reducer?
  - What is a action dispatcher?
- Why do we need to use Redux?
- Connecting Redux with React using React Redux
- Redux state vs React state

## Goal
- Understanding basic of functional programming
- Why do reducer in redux is a pure function?
- The important of pure function
- Fluently using `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `some`, `every`
- Understanding the Redux architecture
- Building an application using mixed React state and Redux state

## Plan
- One Redux training section with fundamental functional programming concept
- One pair programming section about Redux


## Reading (Optional)
- Fullstack React - Part 2
- From Redux (p.452) to Asynchronicity and server communication (p.568)
- Lecture notes

## Tasks and Requimenets
- Building a management application (Can be user management, library management) using Redux
- **Requirement:** Reducer, actions must be designed well

## Test
- Popup test with 10-15 questions about React and Redux
- You will need to achieve at least 70% of total score to pass this test
