# Training 4 - Intermediate React: Calling API with Axios, Fetch API

## Overview
- Using `fetch` API to get data from API
- Using state, props to transfer data from API around components
- Using `axios` as a replacement of `fetch` API
- Using `debounce` and `throttle` (from lodash) to improve the performance

## Goal
- Understanding `dobounce` and `throttle`
- Understanding CORS problem
- Create a simple app that use external API to get and display the data

## Plan
- Pair programming with mentor


## Reading (Optional)
- [Throttling and Debouncing in JavaScript](https://codeburst.io/throttling-and-debouncing-in-javascript-b01cad5c8edf)
